        // Assignment
// Write a program that takes a value from the user and
// prints out that number's position in fibonacci sequence.
// Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the previous two numbers sum up
// to make the next number.
// In this case, take the first two numbers of the sequence to be 1, 1
// e.g. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
// Enter the position you want: 4
// 3
        //SOLUTION
//request number from user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of position in fibonacci sequence you want to observe: ");

//start an array with that number
        int[] number = new int[scanner.nextInt()];

//write a loop with fibonacci sequence

//print out answer
        System.out.println("the number you are seeking is: " + );
